# xenin-coinflip
This is an unofficial repository made regarding the Xenin Coinflip script and custom systems made by community.

## Original script
Only edited files will be uploaded there, this means this won't be functional if you do not own all original ones.  
Please, before doing anything, buy it here : https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/xenin-coinflip.  
This is not a leak or whatever, don't expect those things from me.  

## Repository access
In order to have access to that repository, you need to go through the official Xenin Discord server.  
Link is here > https://discord.gg/5Wsdr3t.  
Then, just verify yourself by going into the #verification channel.  
Repository access won't be given until you verify yourself and have the Coinflip role.  

## Support and updates
Support and updates will be given in case you politely ask for and that's regarding the edited files.  
Whereas, don't expect a fast support or whatever, I'm not paid for doing this (and that's normal).  
Also, note that I'll redirect you to the official support server if you have a problem with the addon itself.  

## Edited files author
These editions have been made by dotCore.  
They're not of the same quality than the original code, and might not be optimized or may not worked as expected.  
I can't be held as responsible for any damages / issues on your server.  

## Regarding leaks and re-upload
Do not re-upload these files somewhere else, it would be pointless and you'll surely get rekted by DMCA.  
Also, do not re-upload the whole addon itself here or somewhere else, that's against laws.  
Finally, try to not be a jerk and credit me + Xenin Team if you want to do it on your own from this base.
